# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

## Results: 

### Data Preprocessing

 #### What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
     - The target variable for this model was the "IS_SUCCESSFUL" column

 #### What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
 - APPLICATION_TYPE—Alphabet Soup application type
 - AFFILIATION—Affiliated sector of industry
 - CLASSIFICATION—Government organization classification
 - USE_CASE—Use case for funding
 - ORGANIZATION—Organization type
 - STATUS—Active status
 - INCOME_AMT—Income classification
 - SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS—Special consideration for application
 - ASK_AMT—Funding amount requested 

 #### What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?


### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

 #### How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?

 #### Were you able to achieve the target model performance?

 #### What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
